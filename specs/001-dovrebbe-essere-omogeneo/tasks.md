# Implementation Tasks: Omogeneità e Ortogonalità

## Setup
1. [X] Initialize project structure (src/, tests/, contracts/, etc.)
2. [X] Confirm technical stack and dependencies (Node.js, Express, Jest, Passport, etc.)

## Tests
3. [X] Write contract tests for API endpoints [P]
4. [X] Write model/entity tests [P]
5. [X] Write integration test scenarios from user stories

## Core Development
6. [X] Implement models/entities for homogeneity and orthogonality [P]
7. [X] Implement services and core logic [P]
8. [X] Implement API endpoints [P]

## Integration
9. [ ] Integrate storage solution (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
10. [X] Integrate testing framework (Jest config + module mocks)
11. [ ] Integrate frontend/backend if applicable (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)

## Polish and Validation
12. [ ] Run all tests and validate requirements
13. [ ] Optimize performance and document implementation

- [P] = Parallelizable task
- Mark completed tasks as [X]
- Resolve all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" before implementation
