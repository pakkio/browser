## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick (for PDF support)
- FFmpeg (for AVI video transcoding)

### Installation

#### System Dependencies (Linux/Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install ImageMagick for PDF processing
sudo apt update
sudo apt install imagemagick

# Install FFmpeg for AVI video transcoding
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Alternative: Install GraphicsMagick
# sudo apt install graphicsmagick
```

#### System Dependencies (macOS)
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install imagemagick

# Install FFmpeg for AVI video transcoding
brew install ffmpeg

# Alternative: Install GraphicsMagick
# brew install graphicsmagick
```

#### Application Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd browser

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment (optional - auth disabled by default)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to configure authentication

# Start the server
npm start
```

### Windows Compatibility

This project is partially runnable on Windows. The core file browsing and viewing of most file types will work. However, the following features will likely fail without manual intervention:

*   **PDF page count:** The server won't be able to determine the number of pages in a PDF.
*   **CBR (RAR) comic book viewing:** The server won't be able to extract pages from `.cbr` files.
*   **Video transcoding:** The server won't be able to transcode `.avi` and `.wmv` files.

To make the project fully runnable on Windows, you will need to install the following dependencies and ensure they are available in your system's `PATH`:

*   **`pdfinfo`:** Part of the [Xpdf](https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html) command-line tools.
*   **`unrar`:** The command-line version of WinRAR. You can find it on the [RARLAB website](https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm).
*   **`ffmpeg`:** A powerful multimedia framework. You can download it from the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

After installing these tools, make sure to add their installation directories to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Authentication Setup (Optional)

For secure environments, enable authentication:

1. **Create `.env` file**:
```env
AUTH=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

2. **Google OAuth Setup**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create/select project → APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`

For local/trusted environments, set `AUTH=FALSE` or omit the `.env` file entirely.

### Custom Directory

Browse a specific directory:
```bash
node server.js /path/to/your/directory
```

## 🧪 Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, and security validation.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- **API Endpoints**: All server routes and error conditions

## 💡 WSL Drive Mounting

For WSL users working with network drives (like RaiDrive):

```bash
# Create mount point
sudo mkdir /mnt/z

# Mount Windows drive in WSL
sudo mount -t drvfs Z: /mnt/z

# For permanent mounting (add to /etc/fstab)
echo 'Z: /mnt/z drvfs defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Unmount when done
sudo umount /mnt/z
```

This allows seamless access to Windows network drives from your WSL environment.
